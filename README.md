## TABLES
### 01: [Preview](https://github.com/IKOMMM/CSHARP_Practice_Code_Snippets/blob/main/%5BTABLE%5D%2001/Program.cs)
- Task:
Create a 2-dimensional array with the size of 4x3 and populate it with whatever values you want.
Then print the contents of the whiteboard on the screen keeping the layout of the whiteboard (therefore 4 rows, 3 columns). Additionally, at the end of the count and print the totals on the screen individual lines. Added subtraction, multiplication, division.  

### 02: [Preview](https://github.com/IKOMMM/CSHARP_Practice_Code_Snippets/blob/main/%5BTABLE%5D%2002/Program.cs)
- Task:
Create a 4-dimensional array of any size and populate it with whatever values you want. Then print n random elements of that table on the screen, printing 4-dimensional coordinates and the stored value. Define for printing a separate, static method that will take two parameters: the array it has to print and the number of items to be printed.
