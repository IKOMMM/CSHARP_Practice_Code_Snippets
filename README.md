# C# Practise Code Snippets in Console App
Solved tasks for C# practice.

## TABLES
### 01: [2D ARRAY 4X3](https://github.com/IKOMMM/CSHARP_Practice_Code_Snippets/blob/main/%5BTABLE%5D%2001/Program.cs)
- Task:
Create a 2-dimensional array with the size of 4x3 and populate it with whatever values you want.
Then print the contents of the whiteboard on the screen keeping the layout of the whiteboard (therefore 4 rows, 3 columns). Additionally, at the end of the count and print the totals on the screen individual lines. Added subtraction, multiplication, division.  

### 02: [4D ARRAY STORED COORDINATES](https://github.com/IKOMMM/CSHARP_Practice_Code_Snippets/blob/main/%5BTABLE%5D%2002/Program.cs)
- Task:
Create a 4-dimensional array of any size and populate it with whatever values you want. Then print n random elements of that table on the screen, printing 4-dimensional coordinates and the stored value. Define for printing a separate, static method that will take two parameters: the array it has to print and the number of items to be printed.

## OVERALL
### 01: [REPLACE VALUES (A=B B=A)](https://github.com/IKOMMM/CSHARP_Practice_Code_Snippets/blob/main/%5BOVERALL%5D%2001/Program.cs)
- Task:
Write a program that takes two variables, e.g. a and b, and replaces their values, that means a do the variable b assigns the value to variable a, and the variable a assigns the value to variable b. By itself the substitution should be in the situation that took place in the sales function as arguments you take two variables a and b. To get that your program works, print the contents of both new before and after the swap.

### 02: [TRY...CATCH DIVIDE BY ZERO EXCEPTION](https://github.com/IKOMMM/CSHARP_Practice_Code_Snippets/blob/main/%5BTABLE%5D%2002/Program.cs)
- Task:
Write a program that takes two integers from the user, divides the first by the other and displays the result on the screen. In the case where the divisor is equal to 0, division
will throw an exception of type DivideByZeroException which should be handled in a try ... catch ... block, so that instead of breaking the program, a message appears on the screen: "You mustn't divide by zero!"
